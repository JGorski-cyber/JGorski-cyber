## Hey there 👋

I'm João Gorski (you can call me John), a **DevOps Engineer** focused on building secure, automated, and scalable cloud infrastructure.

I work primarily with AWS, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and automation, with a strong emphasis on reliability, security-first design, and reproducible environments.

## 🔧 What I’ve been working on

- **AWS Cloud Security Foundation [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JGorski-cyber/aws-cloud-security-foundation)]**  
  Designed and implemented an AWS account security and monitoring baseline using Terraform, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, IAM, S3, and Athena.

- **Event Sentinel — Python Log Triage Tool [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JGorski-cyber/event-sentinel)]**  
  Built a Python-based automation tool to normalize and analyze logs, highlighting suspicious activity and accelerating investigation workflows.

- **E-Commerce Application Platform (In Progress)** [[Application Repo](https://github.com/JGorski-cyber/not-so-simple-ecommerce)] [[IaC Repo](https://github.com/JGorski-cyber/not-so-simple-ecommerce-iac)]    
  Designing a cloud infrastructure platform on AWS with a focus on Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.  
  The emphasis is on platform automation and operational reliability rather than application features.
